# A long-run perspective

.hi[Business cycles] reflect the *short-run* behavior of economic growth.

--

When turning our attention to *long-run* periods, we approach growth as a .hi-orange[secular] (and usually *upward*) trend.

--

<br>

Over time, economies tend to produce .hi[more] goods and services from their *existing* production processes and resources.



--

<br>

[`World Real GDP over time`](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD)

# A long-run perspective

A useful concept when studying growth is .hi[potential] output (i.e., potential GDP).

--

> An economy's .hi-orange[potential output] is the *highest* amount of output it can produce from its existing productive and natural capacities.

--

<br>

Potential output is, then, a .hi[barrier] beyond which an economy cannot expand without either *increasing available factors of production*
or *increasing productivity*.

# How growth happens

# How growth happens

Recalling:

  - A nation's potential output .hi[cannot] increase without it either using more *factors of production* and/or *increasing its productivity*.
  
--

<br>

What are .hi-orange[factors of production]?

  - *Land*;
  - *Labor*;
  - *Capital* (human and physical);
  - *Energy.*
  
---

# How growth happens

One major .hi[issue] with an economy (indefinitely) utilizing more factors of production is there is a .hi-orange[limit] to their use.

--

<br>

Given that, existing factors need to be made .hi[more productive].
  
  
  
--

<br>

In other words, an economy needs to generate .hi-orange[more] output with either the *same* or *less* input use.

---

# How growth happens

Economic growth is more sustainable when there are conditions for .hi[labor productivity] to increase.

--

[`Adam Smith`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith) (1723&mdash;1790) recognized early on that an economy organized through .hi-orange[markets] could allow for:

  1. Workers' .hi[specialization] (with individuals dedicated to certain aspects/stages of production);
  
  2. .hi-orange[Division of labor] (splitting the production processes into smaller tasks).
  
--

<br>

In a *market economy*, the several different markets are .hi[interdependent], which allows individuals to take advantage of the aspects above and trade for all their needs.

--

<br>

As a consequence, the economy's .hi-orange[productivity] and .hi[standards of living] tend to increase.

Looking at this measure in .hi[levels] shows the overall long-run process of economic growth.

But if we would like to know what was the .hi-orange[growth rate] over time, we need to compute these rates from the data in levels.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Growth rate (%)} = \dfrac{\text{Final Period - Initial Period}}{\text{Initial Period}} \ \times 100

.smaller[Then, from the first chart, we can calculate the .hi-orange[quarter-to-quarter growth rate] in GDP per capita:]

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, dev = "svg", fig.height = 7}

# Is growth good?

# Is growth good?

The general view among economists is that growth .hi[increases] our incomes, and thus .hi[improves] our standards of living.

--

<br>

This statement is different from the idea of supporting .hi-orange[unlimited growth].

--

<br>

Applying .b[economic reasoning] to this issue, there are several .hi[costs] associated with economic growth regimes.
