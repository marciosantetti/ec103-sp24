# Key macroeconomic problems

Macroeconomic problems and concerns are diverse, but may be summmarized by .hi[three] major issues:

  1. .hi[Output growth];
  
  2. .hi[Unemployment];
  
  3. .hi[Inflation].
  
--

<br>

Every economic policy maker will state that their goals are .hi[high output growth], .hi-orange[low unemployment], and .hi[low inflation] (or stable prices).

--

<br>

.right[...But are these *feasible* altogether?]


---

# Key macroeconomic problems


On average, economies tend to .hi[rise] over time.

--

However, this process has its short-run  *ups* and *downs*..smallest[.footnote[Picture taken from Case, Fair, and Oster (2012).]]

* These periods of *ups* and *downs* experienced by a national economy are known as .hi[business cycles.]

* The highest point of the business cycle is known as the .hi-orange[peak].

* The lowest, the .hi[trough].

* An economic .hi-orange[expansion] is the period from a *trough* to a *peak*.

* And from *peak* to *trough* we have economic .hi[recessions].

* Most business cycles are not .hi-orange[symmetrical].

# Key macroeconomic problems

<br><br><br>

Over the long-run trajectory of economic growth, business cycles produce different .hi[unemployment] and .hi-orange[inflationary] contexts.

--

<br>

All of these issues will be further investigated in the *upcoming weeks*.


---

# Key macroeconomic problems

While possible explanations for macroeconomic .hi[ups and downs] will be explored in the next lectures, we can say that there will always be .hi-orange[diverse] views on its *causes* and *consequences.*

--

However, some .hi-orange[indicators] may be used as .hi[signs] indicating *when* recessions may occur.

A few examples:

  1. Manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials;
  
  2. [`Index of consumer expectations`](https://www.conference-board.org/topics/consumer-confidence);

# Growth: A recent phenomenon

Measuring .hi-orange[GDP *per capita*] (i.e., *GDP/total population*) is a valid (but rough) measure of a nation's overall standard of living, as it measures how much output each individual would receive in case total output were evenly divided across society members.

--

If, instead, we turn our attention to economic growth, the concept of .hi[output per worker] seems more appealing.

--

<br>

.hi-orange[Output per worker] measures how much output each worker, on average, is producing.

  - It is .hi[not] the same as output *per capita*, since not everyone in the population *formally* works.
  
  - It can also be called .hi[labor productivity].
