# Motivation



---

# Proposed discussion

The last two weeks were dedicated to the main measure of economic size and performance, namely the .hi[Gross Domestic Product] (GDP).

--

By now, you are well aware of what it .hi-orange[includes].

--

  - But what about what it .hi[does not include]?
  - Could we have a .hi-orange[better] measure of economic size and performance?

--


1. *Discuss* among yourselves, *brainstorm* ideas on a .b[better/ideal] measure to capture an economy's size and performance.

2. What would be the .b[components] of this ideal measure?

3. The last .b[20] minutes of class will be dedicated to your arguments .b[in favor] of this measure.

This activity is the *first problem* in **Problem Set 1**, worth *20* points.
